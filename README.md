# Quizzler

This project is a part of a series of projects that I created while learning Flutter.

This was a part of the [The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/) by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/).
